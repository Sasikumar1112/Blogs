# Blogs
I am just using this repo to store my block posts. Since everything will be in open platforms, I don't give a heck about these files present in public repo.

# Motive 
<<<<<<< HEAD
Every people like killers(bad example) have motives for their actions. My motive is simple, I just want to post same post across different platforms so that the info can reach many people as possible (Generous heartðŸ™ƒ). It is always better to write in general format rather than writing for specific platform. `md` files are basic markown files that can used in most platforms.

# Conclusion
**It is better not to look into this repo for your own good**. Ahhaa.. No one ever said that in a README file.
