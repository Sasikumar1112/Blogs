# Discovery
I want to climb the highest tree  
Study stars and their mystery  
I want to touch the clouds above  
Find someone I can talk to, now!

I want to be a designer  
Make dreams that just don't disappear  
**I want to be an artist too**  
**Paint pictures of me and you.**

There are lots of things on this earth  
New ideas that are taking birth  
But before I discover what I want to be  
I must learn to discover me!

I first read this poem when I was 12, and some of its lines still echo in the quiet corners of my inner child.
This whole blog is just the glass that shattered from that lingering resonance.
