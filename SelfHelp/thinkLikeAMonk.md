# Thinking like a monk after Jay Shetty's book
I've read this **Think Like a Monk** by ***Jay Shetty*** about an year ago. But I reopened this book again and revisited the things I've already highlighted to get a gist of the book. I actually learned many things from this book like

**"the universe ain't going to suddenly give you a green light all the way to work. It's a mistake to think that when we read a book, attend the class and implement changes that we will fix everything. The external will never be perfect and the goal isn't perfect"**

This blog is actually just a note for people who already read that and this may help you to choose which part of the book you can read again. The people who haven't read the book can also go through this blog (to increase view count).

# What I've learned
1) The first thing I learned is **the time you read a selfhelp book decide the impact of the book**. I tried to read this book 2 years ago but after completing the first chapter I quit because it was boring. But time passed by and after a year, I got bashed in my work  for my performance. I got frustrated and started cursing the manager. That time the words in this book helped me a lot; it actually helped me to found a solution for the problem 
2) The books was segregated into three parts and each have 3-4 Chapters. Each part have a meditation to practice that and this was also special about this book. 

# Content in the book (for ref)
1) Identity
2) Negativity
3) Fear
4) Intention
5) Purpose
6) Routine
7) The mind
8) Ego
9) Gratitude
10) Relationship
11) Service

# Quotes
I feel like quotes can take you to exact time your read that. So instead of giving a gist or summary on chapter, I am just writing those. The quotes and content will be in order and the chapter number will be in square brackets. Don't think I'm leaking the quotes from the book; Jay also post these quotes in his instagram account.

# WOW
<div align="center"><b>Until the whole world is healed and happy, I haven't finished</b></div>
This was the Dharma of Jay Shetty (author). And it actually inspired me a lot.

# Conclusion
The book was actually good. If I want to read some part again it would be chapter 8 (EGO), 9 (GRATITUDE), 5 (PURPOSE) and 11 (SERVICE).
